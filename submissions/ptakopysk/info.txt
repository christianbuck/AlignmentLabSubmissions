A very simple submission by Rudolf.
Still the Dice, just with some simple heuristics (diagonalization and
Levenshtein):
dice + Levenshtein ratio - abs(i/j-len(f)/len(e)) >= threshold (0.5),
weighted,
and choosing only the max for each e_i and each f_j
(I am quite new to Python so I am partly using this exercise to learn Python... I
don't feel like implementing stuff like IBM model 1 in Python yet...)
